# World shortest chart in VB6

This VB6 implementation may be the smallest source code for a useful chart to date (to my knowledge)! The World smallest chart plots only positive values, namely it takes values from zero up to an upper bound. To take into account the negative values, you can use the chart project that is shown here. The projects in this repository show two js charts and both use the HTML5 canvas object. The first one from file shortest_chart.html contains the shortest chart source code. Basically the implementation is represented by a function named Chart that draws some consecutive numeric values on a canvas object. The second chart found in file simplest_chart_with_axes.html contains an addition to the first, namely it adds the x-axis and y-axis, and the corresponding baseline ticks. There are also two implementations in the js folder that store the Chart function in a separate ".js" file. For more detailed information, note that these native Charts in Javascript, were published in the supplementary materials of the book entitled Algorithms in Bioinformatics: Theory and Implementation. The lines below show how this Chart function can be called:
